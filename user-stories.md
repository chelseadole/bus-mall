#USER STOREIES (Bus Mall, Chelsea Dole)

##User Stores
* As a USER, I want a site that shows me three, clickable images to choose from.
* As a USER, I want to be able to see the compiled statistics of my clicks after 25 selections.
* As a USER, I want to be able to understand the site's functionality â€” even when going in blind.
* As a USER, I want the page to have directions, and to be labeled with BusMall's logo.

##Developer Stories
* As a DEVELOPER, I want to use clean, effective JS, HTML, and CSS.
* As a DEVELOPER, I want to create a system that records choices selected, and works to prevent immediate repetition of img options.
* As a DEVELOPER, I want to utilize objects, and make my site dynamic and scalable.
* As a DEVELOPER, I want to format my image choices so there are three images per page.
* As a DEVELOPER, I want to utilize Event Listeners so that the images refresh (but the page doesn't change) with each click.

##Marketing Research Team Stories
* As a MARKETING RESEARCHER, I want to see the data collected using a readable, well-labeled graph after 25 clicks.
* As a MARKETING RESEARCHER, I want the data to persist, so it will store and update the statistics with each user.
* As a MARKETING RESEARCHER, I also want the site to record the number of times each image is displayed.
* As a MARKETING RESEARCHER, I want the pictures to be consistently sized, with the past clicks/selections kept hidden until the end of the 25-click cycle. (To remove bias.)
